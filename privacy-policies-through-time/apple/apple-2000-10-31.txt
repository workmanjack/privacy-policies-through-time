Protecting your privacy is important to Apple. We hope the following policy will help you understand how Apple collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our website.
Information Collection
If you browse Apple&#146;s website, you do so anonymously. We don&#146;t collect personal information &#151; including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information.
Like many other commercial websites, the Apple website may use a standard technology called a &quot;cookie&quot; to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to About Cookies for more information.
In some of our customer email communication, we use a device called a &#147;click-through URL.&#148; When you click on one of these URLs, you pass through our system before arriving at the website that is your true destination. Apple uses click-throughs to determine the level of interest in particular topics and to measure the effectiveness of our communications. We do not share this data with anyone, and we make no attempt to match click-throughs to particular email addresses.
At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, such as your email address and postal address, for purposes such as corresponding with us, registering at a site, making a purchase, entering a sweepstakes, registering a new product, or participating in an online survey. When you register a product with Apple, for example, we collect the serial number and your name, address, and email address.
We use the personal information you provide to create a personal ID, called Apple ID. (Apple ID is currently available for customers in the US and Canada but will soon be available for Apple customers worldwide.) Your Apple ID gives you easy access to Apple services including product registration and the Apple Store. Here&#146;s how it works. Using a unique identifier (your current email address and a password for security), you fill out your Apple profile with information you feel comfortable sharing with us, such as your name and telephone number. Once you enter your information, your Apple ID saves you time when you order something from the Apple Store or register a new product. You simply enter your Apple ID and password, and the system looks up the information it needs. Also, your Apple ID and password allow you to edit your personal information and preferences at any time, at ww.apple.com/register/changeinfo/. When you establish an iTools account, your birthday (month and year) is collected for password verification; it is not used for any other purposes.
Information Use
If you provide us with your email or postal address, or have done so in the past, we will ask you if we can use it to send you updates on the latest Apple products and promotions. We also ask if you want us to share your personal information with other companies that offer related services. If you do not want us or other companies to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Apple will respect your wishes.
When you supply Apple with your personal information, we may use it to register your product, configure your system, or assist you with connecting to the Internet. We may also use information that you have given us to contact you so that we may learn more about our customers. This will help us to develop better products and services. And if you have given us permission, we may use your personal information to inform you about new products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. These offers may be based on the information you provided in your initial transaction with us or in surveys.
Because Apple operates globally, we make company information available to our worldwide business units. As part of this process, the personal information that you have provided to us may be sent to other Apple business units around the world. Apple maintains intermediary relationships with credit card and shipping companies and as part of our business process provides these companies with customer information in order to conduct business.
Declining Email Offers
Apple provides customers with an easy means to decline to receive email offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the email and informing us of your preferences. All email offers that you receive from Apple will tell you how to decline further email offers.
Children
Apple encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. Kidsafe and MacOS 9 work together to make the Internet a safer place for kids.
Data Security
Apple is fully committed to data security. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information you provide to us online. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us. In this regard, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data while you are on the Internet. At a minimum, we encourage you to change your passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure that you are using a secure browser as you surf the Internet. Apple takes appropriate steps to communicate our privacy policy and guidelines to all employees.
Company Commitment to Privacy
Apple is actively involved in current industry initiatives&#151;such as the Online Privacy Alliance (www.privacyalliance.org)&#151;to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce. If you have a question specific to privacy, please contact us at privacy@apple.com.
Apple&#146;s privacy policy is subject to change at any time. Apple will provide notice 30 days prior to implementing any major changes to our privacy policy.
Apple&#146;s website contains links to other websites and is not responsible for privacy practices of those websites. Apple encourages users to learn about the privcy practices of those websites.
