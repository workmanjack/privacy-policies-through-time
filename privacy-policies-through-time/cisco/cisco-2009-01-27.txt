USA back to top Non-personal/anonymous information collection In some instances, Cisco may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the Cookies section below for more information. In addition, by using some of our products or services, anonymous network information may be transmitted back to us such as: the health of our products and types of devices attached to the network. This information is transmitted back to us so we can determine how users are interacting with our products, to assist us with improving our products, and to provide alerts via the product as to available software updates/upgrades. back to top Sharing your personal information We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so. We may share your Personal Information within Cisco or any of our worldwide subsidiaries for purposes of data processing or storage. We may also share your Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use your Personal Information except for limited purpose of completing the requested service or transaction. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may collect and possibly share Personal Information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Ciscos terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. While navigating Ciscos web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier, not on Cisco.com. This is typically done to host special events, such as contests. When information is collected on behalf of Cisco exclusively, Ciscos privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Cisco sites, the site owners privacy policy will be referenced. It is Ciscos practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Ciscos privacy and security policies. We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order to let us know your preferences, we will require an action on your part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate your consent. back to top Security of your personal information Cisco is committed to protecting the Personal Information you share with us. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. Please visit the Linksys website for more tips for using security features when connected to the Internet using a router. back to top Cookies Like many websites, Cisco uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. You may browse most of Ciscos website without accepting cookies from Cisco; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other Cisco web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser. In addition, Cisco uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browsers cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools. back to top Data retention Cisco will not retain your Personal Information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. back to top Linked websites Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit. back to top Newsgroups/forums If you participate in a Cisco discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Cisco, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participants opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Cisco. back to top Childrens privacy Cisco does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Cisco encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a childs online experience safer: Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.

Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.

Look for website privacy policies. Know how your childs information is treated. Please visit the FTCs website for more tips on protecting childrens privacy online. back to top Transfer of personal information We may transfer your Personal Information to Cisco in the US, to any Cisco subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage. back to top Your California Privacy Rights Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Cisco qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may either Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to privacy@cisco.com. back to top Questions or comments? Should you have any privacy-related questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please send an email to privacy@cisco.com. back to top Cisco may amend this privacy statement from time to time, and at any time. We will post a notice whenever this privacy statement is materially changed. Your continued use of the Cisco website after any change will signify and confirm your assent to those changes.
