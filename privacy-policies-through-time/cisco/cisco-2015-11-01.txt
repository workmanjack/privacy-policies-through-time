Collection of Your Personal Information

We will inform you of the purpose for collecting personal information when we collect it from you and keep it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as required by applicable laws or for legitimate purposes. "Personal information" is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include name, address, email address, phone number, or payment card number. We collect personal information (and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us) for a variety of reasons, such as:

Processing your order.

Personalizing your experience.

Managing a job application.

Collecting information during the testing admissions process when a computer-based certification test is administered to you. Learn more about online testing at http://pearsonvue.com/Cisco.

We and the third parties we engage may combine the information we collect from you over time and across our websites with information obtained from other sources. This helps us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and also helps us better tailor our interactions with you.

If you choose to provide third party personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), we will assume that you have the third party's permission to provide us with the information. Examples include forwarding reference material to a friend or job referrals. This information will not be used for any other purpose.

We do not sell or share your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.

Security of Your Personal Information

We are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us and utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the Internet.

Retention of Personal Information

We will only retain your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required for legitimate purposes or permitted by law.

Use of Cookies and other Web Technologies

Like many websites, Cisco uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at our website. They may also collect information about:

Your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. It allows web servers to locate and identify your computer, which is a unique address assigned to your PC by your Internet service provider or information systems department on a TCP/IP network.

This is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. It allows web servers to locate and identify your computer, which is a unique address assigned to your PC by your Internet service provider or information systems department on a TCP/IP network. Clickstream behavior. For example, the pages you view and the links you click.

These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient, and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. To learn more, read Cisco's Use of Automatic Data Collection Tools

Our website includes widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (such as displaying the news, opinions, music, and more). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the widget. Cookies may also be set by the widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it. Our widget may have an import contacts feature to help you email your contacts. At your request, we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our website.

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Statement. Learn more information about "do not track."

Forums and Chat Rooms

This information could also be used to send you unsolicited messages. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Cisco. We are not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.

Children's Privacy

Cisco does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Please note that the personal information collected by Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad) is subject to the privacy statement posted on the NetAcad websites along with any applicable privacy supplement.

Cisco encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

Teach children never to give personal information (such as name, address, phone number, school, and other information) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.

Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.

Look for website privacy policies and know how your child's information is treated.

Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information

As Cisco is a global organization, we may transfer your personal information to Cisco in the United States of America, to any Cisco subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf, for the purposes of processing or storage. By providing any personal information to us, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, Cisco will still handle your information in the manner described here.

Your California Privacy Rights

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code ï¿½ 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

Cisco qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please email us your request.
