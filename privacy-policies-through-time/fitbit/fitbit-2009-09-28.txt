as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We limit the collection and use of personal information
Certain areas and features of Fitbit.com are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves provision to Fitbit of an email address and a password (collectively the Registration Information). In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, you can also provide additional details about yourself such as height, weight, gender, age, etc. From time to time we may request other personal information to provide you with other benefits of the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. Fitbit may make anonymous or aggregate personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:

Such information does not identify you individually. Access to your Registration Information, Account Credentials, Account Information and any other personal information you provide is strictly restricted to Fitbit employees and contractors, as needed, and in accordance with specific internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

We use this information to improve the quality of the Fitbit Offers and customized content on the Service.
