The New York Times is a licensee of BBBOnLine. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, BBBOnLine's mission is to promote trust and confidence on the Internet through the BBBOnLine Reliability and the BBBOnLine Privacy programs.

WHICH SITES ARE COVERED BY THIS POLICY?
This Privacy Policy applies to the following New York Times Web sites:
NYTimes.com
The New York Times Home Delivery
The New York Times TimesPoints Reward Program
The New York Times Store
The New York Times Learning Network
The New York Times Electronic Edition, which is maintained by NewsStand, maintains its own Privacy Statement.
The New York Times advertising portal, for advertisers of The Times, also maintains a separate Privacy Policy.
Please note, our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.
Personally Identifiable Information
Registration for our Web sites
Anyone can view our sites, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services offered across our different sites.
NYTimes.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income (optional), job industry and job title) to register. By using NYTimes.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our Member Agreement.
The New York Times Home Delivery Web site requires that you supply your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other billing information to process your print subscription request as well as to transact with The Times and manage your account on the Web.
The TimesPoints Rewards Program on the Web requires that, in addition to information collected during registration for the Home Delivery Web site, you enroll up to three credit or debit cards to start accumulating points for this program.
The New York Times Store requires you to register only if you purchase an item. Registration requires that you supply your mailing address, e-mail address and a password.
Paid Products and Services
While the majority of our Web sites are free, we do charge fees for select premium content, products and services, such as TimesSelect, the Archive: 1851-Present, purchases at The New York Times Store, print subscriptions to The New York Times newspaper, among others. To enable the purchase of these and other products, we collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers
On occasion, The New York Times collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than The New York Times, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
The New York Times may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.
Some of our readers are invited to be members of an optional Reader Panel. Panel members agree to participate in surveys about their readership of The New York Times, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Readers are primarily contacted via e-mail, which link to online surveys, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or mail. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only. Name, home address and telephone number are optional.
Special Events and Promotions
We often receive information regarding readers who may attend Times Talks, Arts &amp; Leisure Weekend and other New York Times Special Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.
Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology
Cookies and Other Technologies
As is standard practice on many Web sites, The New York Times uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Users who do not accept cookies from the domain "NYTimes.com" cannot access most areas of our sites.
We reserve the right to place a New York Times Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
For detailed information about our use of cookies, see
Frequently Asked Questions About Cookies in the Site Help area of our Member Center.
We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on NYTimes.com. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site. Please click here to see a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. If you would like more information about this practice and about your option not to accept cookies placed by these companies, please
click here. Acceptance of cookies from domains other than NYTimes.com is optional.
The New York Times Home Delivery Web site also transmits Web site usage information about visitors to the servers of a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on other sites. To do this, we use Web Beacons and cookies provided by our third-party ad server on this site. The information collected and logged on our behalf through this technology is not personally identifiable. For more information about our third-party ad server, or to learn your choices about not having this non-personal information used to target ads to you, please click here.
NYTimes.com is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of NYTimes.com is owned and used by The New York Times. The New York Times reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers. For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to www.omniture.com/policy.html
NYTimes.com is currently contracted with Tacoda Systems, a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of our visitors and customers. All data collected by Tacoda on behalf of our Web sites is owned and used by The New York Times alone. We use this information to help provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about Tacoda’s privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to www.tacoda.com/privacy_policy.html 
We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.
Times Reader
If you download and install the PC-based Times Reader software application, NYTimes.com will track non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information through log files. The log files will be collected by the application and sent to NYTimes.com servers when the user synch's for the latest news. Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of Times Reader. We may share this information for purposes of internal analysis with The New York Times Company, but will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party. NYTimes.com reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable summary information regarding its Times Reader visitors, for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Advertisers on NYTimes.com may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site, and in these instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags/pixel tags) to better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind, we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser. Please click here to see a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies.
IP Addresses
The New York Times logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site.
Log Files
Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our Web.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?
Statistical Analysis
The New York Times may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent. NYTimes.com may share personal information with The New York Times Company for analysis purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships.
Products and Services from The New York Times
From time to time, we may provide subscribers with information and offers about other products and services offered by The New York Times, including subscriptions, TimesSelect, TimesPoints, and other premium products and services.

We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.
User Generated Content (Message Boards, Forums, Reader Reviews and Chats)
We offer message boards for readers in a number of areas throughout our Web sites. The message boards are currently hosted and managed by Prospero, a third party vendor. Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by the New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.

From time to time, The New York Times may obtain e-mail addresses from third party sources to be used for promotional e-mails. You can choose not to receive messages in the future by either (1) following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each e-mail, or (2) you can opt-out.

not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate form. (Effective as
of August 21, 2002.)
HTML E-mail: When you sign up to receive e-mail from us,
you can select either plain text or HTML (with images) format. If you
select the HTML format, we may place a one-pixel gif to determine whether or not readers viewed the e-mail. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer. The New York Times may share this data with others in aggregate only.
E-mails From You: If you send us e-mails, you should be aware that information disclosed in e-mails may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in e-mails. We will use your e-mail address to respond directly to your questions or comments.
E-mail This Article Feature: NYTimes.com readers may use this feature to send links to articles to others through e-mail. The e-mail address(es) that you supply to this service will only be used to send the requested article.
Programs From Our Partners: During the NYTimes.com registration process, new users who select to register for certain featured offers from our partners will begin receiving e-mail from these companies. You will only receive e-mail messages from these companies if you elect this opt-in service. If you elect to opt-out of an e-mail from a partner, you must do so through that partner directly.

IS MY INFORMATION PROTECTED?
Data Security: To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.
OTHER INFORMATION: Compliance with Legal Process
We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).
OTHER INFORMATION: Children's Guidelines
COPPA Compliance: Except for The Learning Network (see below), The New York Times does not knowingly collect or store any personal information, even in aggregate, about children under the age of 13.
The Learning Network: The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12. Within this section, the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor, providing their first name, grade, state/country and, optionally, their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. If an e-mail address is provided, it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child. After responding to the child, the e-mail address is deleted. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we’re concerned about a parent’s right to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network.
These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children’s personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children’s personal information previously collected.
For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact Katherine Schulten, NYTimes.com, 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10018. Telephone: (646) 698-8000.
OTHER INFORMATION: Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail.
