Oracle Privacy Policy
Oracle respects your preferences concerning the collection and use of your Personal Information. The following privacy policies are tailored for the different ways your Personal Information is collected by different Oracle lines of business and offerings.
Oracle Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates (&quot;Oracle&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) respect your preferences concerning the treatment of Personal Information that we may collect. This Policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) lets you know how we collect and use your Personal Information, how you can control its use, and describes our practices regarding information collected from the different Oracle sites that link or refer to this Policy (such as our websites, computer or mobile software applications, social media pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages), as well as through offline sales and marketing activities (collectively, the &quot;Channels&quot;).
The Channels may provide links to or the ability to connect with non-Oracle websites, services, social networks or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share information about you. Those third-party websites or services are beyond our control. We encourage you to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-Oracle websites or services before providing your Personal Information to them.
Personal and Other Information We Collect
Through your interaction with and use of the Channels, Oracle may collect Personal Information, which is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to:
Your name and physical address, email addresses, and telephone numbers
Behavioral or demographic attributes, when tied to personal identifiers
Past transactional behavior on the Channels
Information obtained from third parties on your interests
Information about your company such as the name, size and location of your company and your role within the company
Oracle may also collect Other Information through your interaction with and use of the Channels and non-Oracle websites, which does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual. Other Information may include, but is not limited to:
Unique IDs such as a cookie placed on your computer, mobile or device IDs
Internet Protocol address ("IP address") and information derived from your IP address such as your geographic location
Information about your devices such as information contained in HTTP Headers (defined below) or other internet transfer protocol signals, browser or device type and version, operating system, user-agent strings and information about or from the presence or use of "apps" on your mobile devices, screen resolution, and your preferred language
Behavioral data about your usage of the Channels, such as webpages clicked, websites and content areas visited, date and time of activities
The web search you used to locate and navigate to the Channels
In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information, such as deriving geographical location from your IP address and combining behavioral data about your usage of the Channels with your name. If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
How We Use and Share Information

Provide Oracle Online Communities. Some Channels permit you to: participate in interactive discussions; create a profile; post comments, opportunities or other content; communicate directly with another user; or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these services are moderated and all may be accessed for technical reasons. Oracle does not control the content that users post to these forums or social networks. You should carefully consider whether you wish to submit Personal Information to these forums or social networks and whether you wish to make your profile available to other users, and you should tailor any content you submit appropriately. You should also review any additional terms and conditions that may govern your use of these Channels.

Some of the Personal Information and Other Information uses specified above are not mandatory and may be controlled by you. Please refer to the &quot;Registration and Privacy Choices&quot; section below or view the summary of your Privacy Choices for more information.
Other Information
We may use, transfer, and disclose Other Information we collect for any purpose, except where applicable law requires otherwise. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we will only use it in the same way that we are permitted to use and disclose Personal Information.
How We Collect Information
Oracle and our third party service providers may collect both Personal Information and Other Information from a variety of sources that generally fall into three categories:
Direct Interactions: From your use of and interaction with us through the Channels and other activities such as account creation, submission of registrations and forms, or sales inquiries and transactions.
Publicly Available Data / Data from Third Parties: Data from Automated Interactions on non-Oracle websites, or other data you may have made publicly available, such as social media posts, or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.
Automated Interactions: From the use of technologies such as electronic communication protocols, cookies, embedded URLs or pixels, or widgets, buttons and tools.
Although Oracle&#39;s use of Automated Interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about Oracle&#39;s current approach to information collected from Automated Interactions.
Electronic Communications Protocols: As is true when you visit most websites and apps, Oracle may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type or device type), your IP address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.
Oracle may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the Channels, such as clickstream information (when each Oracle webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), how often you access the Channel, performance data, aggregate usage, or general geo-location data.
Cookies: Oracle's server will query your browser to see if there are "cookies" previously set by our electronic Channels. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. Cookies may collect information, including a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, membership information, and general usage and volume statistical information. Cookies may also be used to collect individualized website use data, provide electronic Channel personalization, or conduct and measure the effectiveness of advertising in accordance with this Policy. Some cookies may remain on users' computers after they leave the website. While the majority are set to expire within 1-24 months of your last visit to the website that set the cookie, others may not expire because of their nature, like cookies that remember opt-out preferences.
Your browser may provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion. Cookies, however, are important to the proper functioning of a site, and disabling them may degrade your experience and interfere with website features and customizations.
Oracle has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with electronic Channels. The service provider(s) may set cookies on behalf of Oracle. Oracle also uses other third party cookies to provide advertising and personalization services in accordance with this Policy, and to track the performance of Oracle advertisements on our Channels and Oracle e-mails.
Managing Cookie Preferences: You may access or change your cookie preferences at any time. If you have any problems using this cookie preference mechanism, please fill out an inquiry form.
Flash Cookies: We may use Flash cookies, also known as &quot;local shared objects,&quot; on our electronic Channels that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are used to remember the site&#39;s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at macromedia.com.
Embedded URLs: Oracle may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the electronic Channels without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Channels, but are not associated with Personal Information and are not used beyond the session.
Embedded Pixels and Similar Technologies: On the electronic Channels, Oracle and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies for the purposes of identifying unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits) and for advertising purposes. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's e-mail address.
The pixel technology used on our Channels enable the synchronization of internal unique identifiers between Oracle (AddThis) and our third party partners to facilitate interest-based advertising. For a list of those third party partners, please click here. Please see the "Cookies and Do Not Track" section below for opt-out options.
Widgets, Buttons, and Tools: Our electronic Channels may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies&#39; services (e.g., a &quot;Like&quot; button or third party map). The widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, or Other Information (such as your browser information, or IP address), to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
Physical Location: We may collect and share the physical location of your device for purposes consistent with this Policy, such as to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.

When we use such lists, the communications will include mechanisms to opt out of receiving Oracle marketing communications.

You have the ability to update your Oracle profile and related Personal Information at any time.

Chief Privacy Officer, Oracle Corporation

Burlington, MA 01803
USA

While the majority of questions and issues related to access can be handled quickly, complex requests may take more research and time. In such cases, issues will be addressed, or you will be contacted regarding the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps, within thirty days.
Retention and Deletion
Oracle will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active; as needed to provide you products or services; as needed for the purposes outlined in this Policy or at the time of collection; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to honor opt-outs), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; or to the extent permitted by law.
At the end of the retention period, Oracle will delete your Personal Information in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.
Advertising
Oracle uses third parties to administer Oracle advertisements on third party electronic channels. Other Information, such as user community or implied or inferred interests, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. Some ads may contain embedded pixels that may write and read cookies or return session connection information that allows advertisers to better determine how many individual users have interacted with the ad.
Oracle may also use advertising technologies and participate in advertising technology networks that collect Other Information from Oracle and non-Oracle websites, as well as from other sources, to show you Oracle-related advertisements on Oracle&rsquo;s own and third-party websites. These advertisements may be tailored to your perceived interests using retargeting and behavioral advertising technologies, a set of practices collectively referred to as &ldquo;Interest Based Advertising&rdquo; in this Policy. Any retargeted or behavioral advertisements served to your browser will contain information on or near it that informs you about the advertising technology partner and how to opt-out of viewing such advertisements. You also may opt out by visiting the Interest Based Advertising portion of the Privacy Choices tab of this Policy. Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving ads from Oracle. It means that you still stop receiving ads from Oracle that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.
Cookie-based tools that allow you to opt-out of Interest Based Advertising prevent Oracle and other participating advertising technology companies from serving interest-related ads to you on behalf of Oracle. They will only work on the Internet browser on which they are deposited, and they will only function only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. These cookie-based opt-out tools may not be as reliable where (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems) cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed. If you delete cookies, change browsers, computers or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
Oracle is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and works with industry-leading companies to address important privacy and consumer protection issues in online advertising. The NAI has created a compliance program that incorporates attestation reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions and annual reporting to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to you and abide by the NAI&#39;s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct. Click here to learn more about the NAI.
Oracle also participates in the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), Direct Marketing Association UK (DMA UK), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC), and European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) self-regulatory programs and adheres to the DAA and EDAA Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
