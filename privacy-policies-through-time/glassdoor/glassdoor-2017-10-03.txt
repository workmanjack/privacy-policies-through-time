It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies only to information we collect, process, and use through Glassdoor. This Privacy and Cookie Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us. Information We Collect and How We Use ItPersonal Information that You Provide Us Actively When you fill out registration forms, submit your resume or provide us with other information actively, you will know what information we are collecting because you are actively submitting it. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you may decide to provide personal information to us: Creating an account; Signing up for email alerts; Completing a form related to one of our products or services; Uploading a resume; Contacting us for technical support or customer service. Depending on how you interact with Glassdoor, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. On a voluntary basis, you may also decide us to provide us more sensitive information such as your social security number; driver's license or other government-issued identification number, or payment information, including a bank account, credit or debit card number.You should not include sensitive data (such as, social security number, driver's license number, credit or debit card numbers, etc.) in any resume you upload to Glassdoor or submit it in any other scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information. If you connect to Glassdoor using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a "Social Networking Site"), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, including information about your friends and connections on that Social Networking Site.

Employers with Free Employer Accounts may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for us to use to send an email encouraging those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on Glassdoor. Email addresses obtained in this manner are used solely for the purposes authorized by the employer. Information We Collect by Automated Means When you use Glassdoor, your device is automatically providing information to us so we can respond and customize our response to you. The type of information we collect by automated means may vary, but generally includes technical information about your computer, such as your IP address or other device identifier, the type of device you use, and operating system version.

These web beacons allow us and third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites.

The information also is used for analytical purposes and to manage technical issues that may arise. We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information. Cookies.

We may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the device type and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, geolocation or email address. Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application. Location Data..

Information We Collect By Other Means We may receive information about your activity on and off Glassdoor from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example: our employer clients and service providers working on their behalf may share with us information about the candidate status of job seekers who apply for positions with these employers (e.g. application status, completed stages of interview process, whether an offer was made, and whether the candidate was hired.)

Our general procedure with respect to civil subpoenas and properly-served demands requesting user data is to require a court order, binding on Glassdoor, before we release such information; In a reorganization or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Privacy and Cookie Policy and compliance with applicable law; If you apply for a particular job through Glassdoor, we will disclose your personal information to the employer to whom you apply and any vendors they are working with that employer to process your application; We may invite you to include your resume or other information in more generally available formats and then offer third-parties the right to view this information, subject to visibility settings you control.

When we share such information, we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or employers.

You will continue to receive generic ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools. You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience. If you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie will also be deleted. Additionally, if you change computers or web browsers, you will need to opt out again. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at AboutCookies.org. If you enable location data for the mobile version of Glassdoor (including any version installed as a native application), you are expressly agreeing that we may use your location data to serve you geo-targeted ads and offers for businesses or employers that are local to you. In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network, rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas or zip codes. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Glassdoor native app settings. Please note: if ads or other features on Glassdoor are provided by third parties, those parties also may set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies.

The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. Tips For A Responsible Job Search. We actively monitor Glassdoor for job postings that violate our Terms of Use. If we detect fraudulent activity, we remove the job posting from Glassdoor. However, fraudulent job postings can sometimes appear and we urge you to exercise caution in your job search. Please consider the following tips when conducting your search: Do not send money to a prospective employer. Do not give out personal or financial account information to a new employer via email. Do not cash checks or transfer funds for your employer. Beware of job postings that ask you to send your resume to a free email service address (e.g gmail, yahoo, etc). Do not include sensitive information like your social security number in your resume. Beware of job listings with spelling errors and bad grammar. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Do your homework. Be sure to research any job opportunity that interests you. If you see a suspicious job posting, please contact us here. If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately report the fraud to your local police and contact Glassdoor. We also recommend that you file an online report with The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Privacy of Minors. Glassdoor is not intended for minors. Minors must obtain parental consent to use Glassdoor. Minors under 13 years of age are expressly prohibited from using Glassdoor or providing any personal information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us here. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we remove such information and terminate the child's account. California Residents California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Data Controller The information about you that we collect through Glassdoor is controlled by Glassdoor, Inc., Mill Valley, California.
