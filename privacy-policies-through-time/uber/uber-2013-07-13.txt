1. What Information Do We Collect?
(a) Information You Provide To Us
Personal Information. We may ask you to provide us
with certain categories of information such as personal information,
which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you
personally, such as your name, e&#45;mail address, and mobile number
(&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;). We may collect this
information through various forms and in various places through the
Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or
when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the
Services, you create a user profile. The current required data
fields are:
Email
Password
Name
Mobile Phone Number
Zip Code
Credit Card Number, expiration date &amp; security code and or
information regarding your PayPal, Google Wallet or other digital
payment accounts
If you choose to upload a photo when registering for our Services,
the photo may be viewable by us and by the drivers who are picking
you up so that they are able to verify your identity. You may
remove or update the photo at any time by logging into your account.
(b) Information We Collect As You Access And Use Our Services
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that
you choose to submit to us, we and our third&#45;party service
providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or
passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or
interact with the Services (&ldquo;Usage Information&rdquo;).
This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using,
the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the areas within
our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other
information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose
, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In
addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier
(&ldquo;Device Identifier&rdquo;) for your computer, mobile
or other device used to access the Services (any, a
&ldquo;Device&rdquo;). A Device Identifier is a number that
is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the
Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device
Identifier. Usage Information may be non&#45;identifying or may be
associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a
Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it
as Personal Information.
In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate
through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic
areas. If you are traveling in a vehicle requested via our Services,
the driver&rsquo;s mobile phone will send your GPS coordinates,
during the ride, to our servers. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can
define one&rsquo;s location to within 50 feet. We collect this
information for various purposes &ndash; including to determine the
charge for the transportation you requested via our Services, to
provide you with customer support, to send you promotions and
offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business
purposes. We may also have features that allow you to share this
information with other people (such as your family, friends or
colleagues) if you choose.
For example, when you choose to split the fare for a trip with other
users, all users splitting the fare can see the GPS coordinates
recorded by the driver&rsquo;s mobile phone for that particular
trip, as well as certain information about the users (such as the
User&rsquo;s name and photos) who have agreed to split the fare for
that trip.
A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information
include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent
technology and methods hereafter developed):
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device
when it is used to access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data
file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug&#45;in that may be
built&#45;in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and
Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without
limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your
visits to our web pages. Cookies work by assigning a number to the
user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.
If you do not want information to be collected through the use of
cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of
cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a
preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose
to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of
the Services may not function properly or may not be able to
customize the delivery of information to you.
You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of
cookies (or the resulting information) by third&#45;parties, and use
of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web
programming code called web beacons (also known as &ldquo;1x1
GIFs&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear GIFs&rdquo;) may be included in our web
and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are tiny graphics
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are
used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to
cookies, which are stored in a user&rsquo;s computer hard drive, web
beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size
of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons or similar
technologies help us better manage content on our Services by
informing us what content is effective, count users of the Services,
monitor how users navigate the Services, count how many e&#45;mails
that we send were actually opened or to count how many particular
articles or links were actually viewed. We do not tie the
information gathered by web beacons to our customers&rsquo; personal
information.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming
code that is designed to collect information about your interactions
with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is
temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a
third party service provider, is active only while you are connected
to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect
about you through our web site or Mobile Application with outside
records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve
you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to
purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to
you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources
with information we collect through the Services. In those cases,
we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information
received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
(d) Information You Provide About A Third Party
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our
Services or a job position, we will ask you for your friend&rsquo;s
name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a
one&#45;time email inviting him or her to visit the Services. We
store this information for the sole purpose of sending this
one&#45;time email and tracking the success of our referral program,
and do not use this information for any other marketing purpose
unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say
otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any
send&#45;to&#45;a&#45;friend functionality through our Services,
your e&#45;mail address may be included in the communication sent to
your friend.
If you choose to split a trip fare, we will ask you for your
friend&rsquo;s mobile number. We will send your friend a text
message informing him or her that you have requested that he or she
split the fare for a trip. Your friend may accept or decline your
request to split your fare. We will not use this information for
any marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or
we explicitly say otherwise.
Your friend may contact us through
t.uber.com/support to request
that we remove this information from our database.
(e) Information Collected by Mobile Applications
Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your
mobile, tablet computer or similar device (&ldquo;Mobile
Application&rdquo;). You agree that we may collect and use
technical data and related information, including but not limited
to, technical information about your device, system and application
software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to
facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and
other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications.
When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application
may automatically collect and store some or all of the following
information from your mobile device (&ldquo;Mobile Device
Information&rdquo;), including without limitation:
Your preferred language and country site (if applicable)
Your phone number or other unique device identifier assigned to
your mobile device &ndash; such as the International Mobile
Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID number
The IP address of your mobile device
The manufacturer and model of your mobile device
Your mobile operating system
The type of mobile Internet browsers you are using
Your geolocation
Information about how you interact with the Mobile Application and
any of our web sites to which the Mobile Application links, such
as how many times you use a specific part of the mobile
application over a given time period, the amount of time you spend
using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile
Application, actions you take in the Mobile Application and how
you engage with the Mobile Application
Information to allow us to personalize the services and content
available through the Mobile Application
We may use information automatically collected by the Mobile
Application (including the Mobile Device Information) in the
following ways:
To operate and improve our Mobile Applications, other Services,
our company&rsquo;s services, and tools;
To create aggregated and anonymized information to determine which
Mobile Application features are most popular and useful to users,
and for other statistical analyses;
To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy
Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the
Mobile Application, and to investigate fraud, chargeback or other
matters;
To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for
you, or the communications sent to you through the Mobile
Application.
With respect to geo&#45;location data we track through your Mobile
Device, we use that geo&#45;location information for various
purposes &ndash; including for you to be able to view the drivers in
your area that are close to your location, for you to set your pick
up location, so the drivers are able to find the location from which
you wish to be picked up, to send you promotions and offers, and to
allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to
share this information with other people. Except as otherwise
permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information
with third parties for any purpose and will only use this
information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability
to request transportation via Uber&rsquo;s Mobile Application. You
may at any time no longer allow our Mobile Application to use your
location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device level.
We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your
first name and your photo, if you have chosen to upload your photo
to your profile) to the driver/partner who accepts your request for
transportation so that the driver may contact and find you, and to
those users with whom you have agreed to split the fare for a
particular trip. The companies for which drivers work (that are
providing the transportation service) are also able to access your
Personal Information, including your geo&#45;location data.
We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile
Application usage information with any Personal Information you
provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal
Information.
Personal Information may also be collected and shared with
third&#45;parties if there is content from the Mobile Application
that you specifically and knowingly upload to, share with or
transmit to an email recipient, online community, website, or to the
public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or
information about you or your ride that you choose to share with
others through features which may be provided on our Services. This
uploaded, shared or transmitted content will also be subject to the
privacy policy of the email, online community website, social media
or other platform to which you upload, share or transmit the content.
(f) Information Collected from Job Applicants
If you wish to apply for a job on our web site(s), we will collect
Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number
and may collect additional information such as resume, gender, and
your ethnicity. We use the information collected within this area of
the web site(s) to determine your qualifications for the position in
which you have applied and to contact you to set up an interview.
2. How Do We Use The Information Collected?
Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information or Usage
Information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using
the Services.
Based upon the Personal Information you provide us when registering
for an account, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your
username and password. We will also communicate with you in
response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and
to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email,
telephone, or SMS or text message, in accordance with your wishes.
We use your information to closely monitor which features of the
Services are used most, to allow you to view your trip history,
store your credit card information on a secure page, view any
promotions we may currently be running, rate trips, and to determine
which features we need to focus on improving, including usage
patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should offer
or focus services, features and/or resources.
We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that
we are able to serve you the correct app version depending on your
device type, for troubleshooting and in some cases, marketing
purposes. The credit card information you provide in your personal
profile at sign&#45;up is not stored by us, but is stored and used
by our third party credit card processors in order for them to
process payment that you owe third parties for transportation
services received by you.
We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems
with our computer server, and to administer our web site(s). Your IP
address is used to help identify you, but contains no personal
information about you.
We will send you strictly service&#45;related announcements on rare
occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our
Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send
you an email. Generally, you may not opt&#45;out of these
communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not
wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
In addition, we may use your Personal Information or Usage
Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with
information or services or process transactions that you have
requested or agreed to receive including to send you electronic
newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional
materials on behalf of us or third parties; (2) to process your

is active and valid; (3) to improve the Services or our services, to

our discretion, changes to the Services and/or the Services&rsquo;
policies; (6) for internal business purposes; (7) for inclusion in
our data analytics; and (8) for purposes disclosed at the time you
provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy
Policy.
Please note that information submitted to the Services via a
&ldquo;contact us&rdquo; or other similar function may not receive a
response.
3. How and When Do We Disclose Information to Third Parties?
We may share non&#45;personally identifiable information, such as
aggregated user statistics and log data, with third parties for
industry analysis, demographic profiling, to deliver targeted
advertising about other products or services, or for other business
purposes. We do not sell, share, rent or trade the information we
have collected about you, including Personal Information, other than
as disclosed within this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide
your information. We do not share your Personal Information with
third parties for those third parties&rsquo; direct marketing
purposes unless you consent to such sharing at the time you provide
your Personal Information.

You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information
and/or marketing offers directly from third parties. If you do
agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal
Information will be disclosed to such third parties and all
information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and
practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for the
privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore,

parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from them. If
you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication
from a third party, you will need to contact that third party
directly.
(b) Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.
We use third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
Services, provide or perform certain aspects of the Services on our

to only the information needed by the vendor to carry out the
services they are performing for you or for us. Each of these
vendors are obligated not to disclose or use Personal Information
for any other purpose.

these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their

(c) Co&#45;branded Services.
Certain aspects of the Services may be provided to you in
association with third parties (&ldquo;Co&#45;Branded
Services&rdquo;) such as sponsors and charities, and may require
you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co&#45;Branded
Services will identify the third party. If you elect to register

that Co&#45;Branded Service and will be subject to their posted
privacy policies.

a &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;) through the Services that may
require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are
agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may

sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in
advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you
choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed
to third parties or the public in connection with the administration
of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection,
prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the
Promotion&rsquo;s official rules, such as on a winners list.
(e) Administrative and Legal Reasons.
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and
private parties to enforce and comply with the law. Thus, we may
access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information
(including Personal Information), including disclosure to third
parties such as government or law enforcement officials or private

discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to
you.
(f) Business Transfer.

restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our membership
interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during
the course of any due diligence process.
4. What is Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can I Opt&#45;Out?
Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses
information collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing
behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they
have made. This information is then used to select which
advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on
websites other than our web site(s). For example, if you have shown
a preference for nursing while visiting our web site(s), you may be
served an advertisement for nursing&#45;related programs when you
visit a site other than our web site(s). The information collected
is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it
does not include any information that could be linked back to a
particular person, such as their name, address or credit card
number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes
from us or through third party website publishers.
If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from us that
occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please
click here
to access the NAI Opt&#45;Out Page. Please note that this will opt
you out of targeted ads from our Company and any other participating
advertisers. If you opt out, you may continue to receive online
advertising from us; however, these ads may not be as relevant to
you.
In order for behavioral advertising opt&#45;outs to work on your
Device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete
cookies, buy a new Device, access our Services from a different
device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers,
you will need to opt&#45;out again. If your browser has scripting
disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral
advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.
Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether
scripting is active or disabled.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view
and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your
online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine
the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI
Opt&#45;Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member
companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to
those companies.
5. What About Information I Disclose Publicly?
(a) User Generated Content and Public Information.
The Services may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums
or other ways to permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user
profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer
graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other
content, including Personal Information (collectively,
&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;). We or others may reproduce,
publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline
in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed).
Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability
to share it with third parties across the Internet. You should be
aware that any User Content you provide in these areas may be read,
collected, and use by others who access them. Thus, please think
carefully before deciding what information you share, including
Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please
note that Company does not control who will have access to the
information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that
parties who have access to such publicly available information will
respect your privacy or keep it secure. This Privacy Policy does
not apply to any information that you disclose publicly, share with
others or otherwise upload, whether through the Services or
otherwise. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of
any content or information that you disclose or receive through the
Services.
To request removal of your User Content from our blog or community
forum or similar features, contact us through
t.uber.com/support. In some
cases, we may not be able to remove your User content, in which case
we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
(b) Name and Likeness.
We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal
Information that is part of your User Content, and we may use the
content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing,
publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions
regarding User Content you submit to the Services, please review our
Terms and Conditions.
6. Does Third Party Content And Links To Third Party Services Appear on the Services?
The Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party,
and those third parties may collect web site usage information and
your Device Identifier when web pages from any online or mobile
Services are served to your browser. In addition, when you are
using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or
applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that
we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you click
on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from one of
our websites onto a different web site. These other web sites may
send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit
Personal Information and may or may not have their own published
privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our
Services and to read the privacy statements of all third party web
sites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to
third parties.
7. What About Social Media Features and Widgets?
Our online and mobile Services may include social media features,
such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a &ldquo;Share
This&rdquo; button, or interactive mini&#45;programs that run on our
online and mobile Services. These features may collect your IP
address, which page you are visiting on our online or mobile
Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a
third party or hosted directly on our online Services. Your
interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the
privacy policy of the company providing them.
8. How Do I Change My Information and What If I Cancel My Account?
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information
you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part
of account registration. If your Personal Information changes, or
if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, delete
inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on our
member information page or by contacting us through
t.uber.com/support. We will make
good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active
databases as soon as reasonably practicable.
You may also cancel or modify your communications that you have
elected to receive from the Services by following the instructions
contained within an e&#45;mail or by logging into your user account
and changing your communication preferences.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use
your information to provide you services, contact us through
t.uber.com/support.
We will retain your Personal Information and Usage Information
(including geo&#45;location) for as long as your account with the
Services is active and as needed to provide you services. Even
after your account is terminated, we will retain your Personal
Information and Usage Information (including geo&#45;location, trip
history, credit card information and transaction history) as needed
to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve
disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an
account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card
companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate
activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reason.
After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated,
and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide
our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be
solely for analytic purposes.
9. What Should Parents Know About Children?
The Company cares about the safety of children. Because our Services
are not directed toward minors, no one under 18 (and certainly no
children under 13) are allowed to register with or use the Services.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under
the age of 18. If we discover that we have collected personal
information from a person under 18, we will delete that information
immediately. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor under the
age of eighteen (18) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal
Information to us, please contact us at
privacy@uber.com..
10. What About Security?
The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect is
securely stored within our databases, and we use standard,
industry&#45;wide, commercially reasonable security practices such
as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for
protecting your information &#45; such as any portions of your
credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your
entire credit card information) and geo&#45;location information.
However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system
is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases,
nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be
intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or
wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the
Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose
your password to anyone.
11. What About Changes To The Privacy Policy?
From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect
changes to our information practices. Any changes will be effective
immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If we
make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the
e&#45;mail address specified in your account) or by means of a
notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We
encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest
information on our privacy practices.
12. Your California Privacy Rights
California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law, California
Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to
requests from California customers (those who have an established
business relationship with us) asking about the business&rsquo;
practices related to disclosing personal information to third
parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes.
Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to
disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the
third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes unless the customer
first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure (opt&#45;in) or if the
customer has exercised an option to opt&#45;out of such
information&#45;sharing (opt&#45;out).
We have opted for this alternative approach, and we do not share
personal information of customers information to third parties for
the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes unless you
provide us with permission at the time you provide such customer
information.
13. What About Consent To Transfer Information To The United States?
If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be
aware that information we collect, including, Personal Information,
will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.
The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those
of the country in which you are located, and your Personal
Information may be subject to access requests from governments,
courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of
the United States. By using the Services or providing us with any
information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of
your information in the United States.
