BY USING OUR WEBSITE AND MOBILE APPLICATION (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SERVICE"), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.
We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Service and/or email notification.

Children Under the Age of 13
The Company cares about the safety of children. Because the Service is not directed toward kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with or use the Service. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be "bumped-out" of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.
Information We Collect
Upon registration with the Service, a user profile is developed to further customize the user’s experience. The current required data fields are:
Email
Password
Name
Mobile Number
Zip Code
In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our website (the "Website") or use the Service, including, but not limited to geographic areas. If you are traveling in a vehicle ordered via the Service, the driver’s mobile phone will record your GPS coordinates. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one’s location to within 50 feet.
To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser.
Users of the Website should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of the Company’s computer servers or through the use of "cookies". Cookies are files a website can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer’s files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. Users should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. There may, however, be some features of the Service which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.
