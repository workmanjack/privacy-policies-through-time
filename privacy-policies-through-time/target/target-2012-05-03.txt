How is this Information Protected?
Security Methods
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your information. This includes encrypting your credit and debit card number.
E-mail Security
&quot;Phishing&quot; is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail.
Safe Shopping Guarantee
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. If your credit card provider does hold you liable for any part of this $50, we will cover this liability for you, provided the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made in our stores or at our website while using the secure server.
Information About Children
We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us or call 800-440-0680.
