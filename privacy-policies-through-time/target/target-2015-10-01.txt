Privacy Policy Pharmacy Privacy Clinic Privacy Terms + ConditionsTarget Subscriptions California Privacy Rights Wireless (WiFi) Service Identity Protection Guide
Target Privacy Policy Spanish Translation (Traducción en español) At Target, we want you to know how we collect, use, share, and protect information about you. By interacting with Target through our stores, websites, and mobile applications, you consent to the use of information that is collected or submitted as described in this privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically.	 	What Information is Collected?	Third-Party Automated Collection and Interest-Based Advertising	How Is Your Information Used?	How Is Your Information Shared?	What Choices Do You Have?	California Residents	How Do You Access and Update Your Personal Information?	How Is Your Personal Information Protected?	Children’s Personal Information	How Do You Contact Target? 		 	What Information Is Collected?	Types of information we collect may include: 		Name	Mailing address	E-mail address	Phone (or mobile) number	Date of birth or age	Driver’s license number	Credit/debit card number	Purchase/return/exchange information	Registry or list information	Your mobile device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, device date and time, unique device identifiers, mobile network information)	How you use our sites and mobile applications, search terms, pages you visit on our mobile applications, and application performance, as discussed further below	Geo-location and in-store location (with your consent)	Facebook ID, profile picture, gender, age range, friends' IDs (with your consent)	Google ID, profile picture (with your consent)	 	If you choose not to provide information we may not be able to provide you with requested products, services or information.	Automated Information Collection 	We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target guest. If we are able to identify you as a Target guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile applications. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.	In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.	Target Automated Collection	We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes, but is not limited to: the pages you visit on our site or mobile application, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms, and IP-based geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. This includes Target content presented on another website or mobile application, for example, Target Weekly Ad. These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and Short Message Service (SMS)/text messages you have chosen to receive. We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention purposes. 	 	Third-Party Automated Collection and Interest-Based Advertising	Target participates in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising. We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online. Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA. 	We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications. This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies use non-personally-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon, or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information.	Our Do Not Track Policy: Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of interest based advertising. To learn more about IBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website. Options you select are browser and device-specific. 	Mobile Location Information	If you have downloaded one or more of our mobile applications, you can opt-in to location sharing for additional application capabilities. For example, geo-location will use your device’s latitude and longitude or your device’s location capabilities (e.g. GPS or Wi-Fi) to let you find nearby Target stores. Or, in-store location through the use of beacons, your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies, or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more. To learn how to opt-out of sharing your location with Target, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy. 	User Experience Information	In order to improve guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our guest relations representatives in resolving issues guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g. information entered during checkout process), and browser information. 	Social Media	Target engages with guests on multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, or request guest service via social media we may contact you via direct message. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use. 	Social Media Widgets	Our sites and mobile applications include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. 	Information from Other Sources	We collect data that’s publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances. 	We also obtain information provided by third parties. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing guest information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our guests (e.g., adding address information).	This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you. 	Store Cameras	We use cameras in and around our stores for security purposes and for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. 		How Is Your Information Used? 	Examples of how we use the information we collect include:	Product and Service Fulfillment 		Fulfill and manage purchases, orders, payments, and returns/exchanges	Respond to requests for information about our products and services in our stores, or on our website, mobile website, or mobile applications or to otherwise serve you	Connect with you regarding guest service via our contact center, guest service desk, or on social media or internet chat platforms	Provide services such as Gift Registry or a shopping list	Administer sweepstakes and contests	Conduct a transaction where we collect information required by law (for example, pseudoephedrine or age-restricted purchases)	Allow you to, using our mobile applications: find a store nearest to your location via Store Finder, show you a map of the store (if available), sign up for coupons, search for products and check availability, check prices, provide product ratings and reviews, track your orders, scan a UPC barcode or QR code, use voice recognition to add to your list, update information, etc.	 	Our Marketing Purposes		Deliver coupons, mobile coupons, newsletters, in-store receipt messages, e-mails, mobile messages, and social media notifications	Provide interactive features of the website or mobile applications, such as product reviews or Weekly Ad, send marketing communications and other information regarding products, services and promotions	Administer promotions, surveys, and focus groups 		Internal Operations 		Improve the effectiveness of our website, stores, mobile experience, and marketing efforts	Conduct research and analysis, including focus groups and surveys	Perform other business activities as needed, or as described elsewhere in this policy	 	Prevention of Fraud and Other Harm	 	Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft and otherwise protect our guests and our business (e.g. product recalls)	 Legal Compliance 		For example, assist law enforcement and respond to legal/regulatory inquiries 			How Is Your Information Shared?

These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. 	Legal Requirements	We may disclose information we collect when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements; to facilitate the financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or disposal of all or part of our business or assets; or to protect the rights property or safety of our company, our guests or others. 	Elsewhere at Your Direction	At your direction or request, or when you otherwise consent, we may share your information. For example, if you create a gift registry or shopping list and elect to make it available to the public, your information will be accessible on our website, mobile or social applications, and on kiosks in our stores. 	Sharing with Other Companies (for their marketing purposes)	We may share your personal information with other companies, or organizations which are not part of Target. These companies and organizations may use the information we share to provide special offers and opportunities to you.
