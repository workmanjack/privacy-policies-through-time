If you need help accessing your information related to a financial product offered by a Walmart partner, we will assist you with that request if you contact us via the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section below. If you need assistance with your Optical or Pharmacy information, please visit the Pharmacy or Optical section below for instructions on accessing these records. How We Secure Your Information Securing your information is a company priority. Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information. When we do have to collect your most private personal information, such as Social Security Numbers, we will protect its confidentiality, prohibit its unlawful disclosure, and limit access to authorized personnel only. Online Protections Your account information is protected by the password you use to access your online account. Please keep this password confidential. We also use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your account information will be protected during transport across the Internet. Walmart.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of a website, which is any page containing any of your account information, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying website security information will appear. This certificate indicates that your personal information is transmitted in encrypted form to a Walmart.com web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server. Hard Copy and Electronic Storage Protections Personal information that is maintained in our offices or stores is subject to physical, administrative, and technical controls as well. Hard copies of private information are maintained in locked locations or cabinets with similar restrictions for electronic storage of private information. When disposed of, the information is shredded, destroyed, erased, or otherwise made unreadable. Privacy Protections for Specific Types of Information Pharmacy and Optical Departments When you use our Pharmacies or Vision Centers, you may provide us with your health information so that we may process your request. We understand the sensitive nature of such information and respect your privacy by keeping it confidential. This includes complying with federal law (the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act or HIPAA) and applicable state laws. Our Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we protect your information maintained by our Pharmacies and Vision Centers, and how you can access your records. A copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices is available online by visiting Pharmacy or Vision Center. A copy of the Notice is also provided to you by the Pharmacy or Vision Center at the first time of service, or can be requested at any time at your local Walmart. Financial Products and Services As you use Walmart financial products and services, the privacy of your personal information is protected under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB) and applicable state laws. Your personal information is protected whether you are a current or former customer. These financial products and services include money orders, money transfers, credit card offerings, bill payment, and check cashing. Walmart provides you check cashing services directly. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information related to this service. For all other services, we serve as an agent for suppliers to offer you financial products and services. Even though we are an agent for these services, we work with our partners to ensure they provide appropriate privacy policies and protections. Below is the list of our financial services partners, along with a link to their privacy policies: Credit Cards offered through GE Money Bank Money Transfers, Money Orders, and Express Bill Pay offered through MoneyGram Money Card offered through Green Dot and GE Money Bill Payment offered through CheckFreePay We also protect the credit or debit card information we collect during transactions. We comply with industry requirements known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI Standards). These standards require safeguards for handling and securing customer information. These include using secure networks; encryption or other protection of cardholder data; physical and technical access controls; monitors and tests of security systems; and information security policies. Privacy of Children Online We are committed to protecting children&rsquo;s online privacy. In order to protect children&rsquo;s personal information, and to meet the standards of the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 on Walmart websites without prior parental consent. Walmart.com is a general audience website not geared towards children. In several areas of Walmart.com, such as when customers contact us via email, create a Walmart.com account, or sign up for e-mail newsletters and alerts, we ask for birth year information. We ask for this to help us ensure that children do not provide us personal information on the site. Please contact us at the email or postal address provided in the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section of this policy if you believe we may have collected information from your child and we will work to delete it. International As a global company, Walmart has separate privacy policies for its international offices. When you give us personal information on a website or in a store, the information may be sent to servers outside of the country where you provided the information. Walmart takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy or any privacy policy that applies to a Walmart international site or store where you provided your information. Changes to the Walmart Privacy Policy Please check our privacy policy periodically for changes. We will also notify you of significant updates and will post the date it was last updated at the bottom of the privacy policy.
