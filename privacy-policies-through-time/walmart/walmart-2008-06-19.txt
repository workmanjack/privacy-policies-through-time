How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.
Walmart.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of this Site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a Walmart.com Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you signed up for an account at Walmart.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Walmart.com will ever ask you for your password.
The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to My Account. Log in with your email address and password, then click "Change Name, Email &amp; Password" and enter a new password.

Cookies and Other Computer Information
When you visit Walmart.com, you will be assigned a permanent "cookie" (a small text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of this cookie is to identify you when you visit the Site so that we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience.
You can choose to browse on Walmart.com without cookies. However, without these identifier files you will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain features of the Site. These features include storing your shopping cart for later use and providing a more personalized shopping experience. Each browser is different, so check your browser?s "Help" menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to Walmart.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the Site and will not sell or rent this information to any third parties.
We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers' activities on the Site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the Site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check your browser?s "Help" menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

Third Party Advertising
Walmart.com participates in cookie-based ad network advertising, 
known as ad serving, for a portion of the advertising found on the 
Site. This means that our ad serving partner uses cookies, web 
beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements 
tailored to the interests you have demonstrated by browsing on 
this and other websites you have visited. The ad serving system 
also helps determine whether you have seen a particular 
advertisement before in order to avoid sending you duplicate 
advertisements. We do not permit our ad serving partner to 
collect personal information about you on the Site, nor do we 
transmit to them any personal information about you. Our partner 
may use non-personal information about you (like browser 
information) that they collect or we send them to display ads on 
Walmart.com. This information will help improve the relevance 
of advertising you see on our site as well as other websites you 
view. Our ad serving partner may also use non-personal 
information about its own users, which may include you, to select 
ads to serve on our pages. Click here to 
learn more
about the ad serving business practices and privacy 
policies of our ad serving partner, including how to decline 
participation in use of ad serving in this manner on Walmart.com.

How We Protect the Privacy of Children
To protect children's personal information and to meet the standards of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect any personal information from children under 13 that can be used to specifically identify them. Except for the Wal-Mart Toyland Site (further described below), Walmart.com is a general audience website not geared toward children. Children under the age of 13 may browse this Site, but they may not create a Walmart.com account, make a purchase, sign up for email newsletters or participate in contests or surveys.
In several areas of Walmart.com, such as when customers contact us via email, create a Walmart.com account or sign up for email newsletters and alerts, we ask for birth year information. This information helps us ensure that children do not provide us with their personal detailed information.
We do not save birth year information, or use it for any marketing, promotional or any other purpose.
We appreciate your cooperation in helping enforce children's online privacy. Still have questions? We invite you to review our Privacy Policy, or get more information on COPPA from the Federal Trade Commission.

The Wal-Mart Toyland Site
The Wal-Mart Toyland Site is linked to Walmart.com and is designed to be a fun way for children to build Wish Lists for their parents and other adult relatives. This Privacy Policy also applies to all activities conducted and information, if any, collected on the Wal-Mart Toyland Site. The site will not collect any personal information from children that can be used to specifically identify them. The only information that may be collected about the child is a first name, as an optional feature to improve the interactivity of the Wal-Mart Toyland Site. The site will also collect the name and email address of a parent and/or adult relative the child chooses to send his/her Wish List to. This information will only be used to send the child's Wish List and will not be saved or used for any other purpose. Although the Wal-Mart Toyland Site does not save the recipient's email address, it does save the Wish List. If a parent so chooses they can delete their child's Wish List by:
Deleting any bookmark or link to the Wish List their child may have created; or
Clicking the Start Over button anywhere within the Wish List function
