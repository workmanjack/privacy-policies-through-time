When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information
We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives, service providers, and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with this Site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; storing, sharing and retrieving customers' photo images in our Photo Center; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experience; enabling access to our partners' web sites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; completing payment method processing; and providing the BabyConnection.com web site to our customers as discussed in more detail below.

How You Can Control the Use of Your Personal Information
You can modify or delete your personal information anytime. Simply go to Your Account. Log in with your email address and password, then click "Credit Card Information", "Checking Account Information", "Address Book" or "Change Name, Email &amp; Password" and edit or delete whatever information you wish.

How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet
Walmart.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of this Site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a Walmart.com web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you created an account at Walmart.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Walmart.com will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to Your Account. Log in with your email address and password, then click "Change Name, Email &amp; Password" and enter a new password.

&nbsp; &nbsp;How You Can Decide What Marketing Communications You Receive From Us
Walmart.com may from time to time send you email messages or other forms of marketing communications describing new items, featured merchandise and great values. You can choose to stop receiving any marketing emails from us at any time. Simply go to Your Account, sign in, click "Newsletter Email Preferences" and remove the check in the box next to the online email newsletter(s) you would no longer like to receive. Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your request. If you would prefer to stop receiving other forms of marketing communications from us, please follow the directions on the marketing materials from us or contact our Customer Service department.
The only email messages you will receive from Walmart.com when you elect not to receive marketing emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Customer Service inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. In addition, we may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls. Finally, you will receive service and reminder emails if you register to use certain Walmart.com services, such as the Photo Center, Pharmacy, Vision Center, Music Downloads, Gift Registry and DVD Rentals, or if you elect to participate in our Market Research testing.
