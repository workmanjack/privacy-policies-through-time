Information Verizon Collects
What information does this Web site gather?
Verizon collects personal information such as name, address, and e-mail address, when you knowingly provide it to us. In addition, Verizon may collect other information provided by you, such as your credit card number, billing address, Social Security number (SSN) and date of birth, when you set up an online account or order service online. Our Web servers automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as pages visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies). We use these statistics to monitor our site's performance and to make it easier for you to use.
If you choose to use an available referral service to tell a friend about our site or a specific product or service, we will ask for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will then send your friend a one-time e-mail regarding our site or the featured product or service. Verizon uses this information for purposes of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of the referral service.

What happens when I provide personal information on this Web site?
When you supply information for a specific purpose, such as online ordering of a Verizon service, we use the information for that purpose.
When you use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually identifiable information as we would if obtained in a non-electronic manner. Such information may include:
Publishing your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published or non-listed number)
Evaluating your service needs and contacting you regarding additional services you may find useful
If the way we use personally identifiable information changes, Verizon will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and giving you the opportunity to opt out of such use.

What happens when I provide information on registration forms?
When you choose to register with verizon.com or any other Verizon site, we request accurate contact information and preferences that help us better serve you. You will be able to choose if your contact information is used to send you company and product information, special offers, and in some cases, newsletters.
If you're a local Verizon phone service customer, you may be given the option to register a profile with us (limited to specific areas). We would then store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase from us in the future. Customers have access to their account information on their monthly bills or by establishing an account online.
Anytime you register with us you may:
Elect not to receive (opt out) commercial e-mail messages. The primary purpose of these messages is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a Verizon product or service. At any time after the initial registration, you can opt out by selecting the opt-out cancel option in your profile within the application itself.
Update your contact and personal information anytime by updating your account and your profile within the application.
In order to improve your experience with us, we may decide to improve our site's ability to obtain information about users. We will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Does Verizon sell or give my information to non-Verizon companies?
No. We do not sell or disclose individually identifiable information obtained online about our visitors to anyone outside of Verizon. The only exceptions to this rule are the following:
If you specifically authorize Verizon to share your information with another company
It is required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site
Disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees, or property
Publishing your name, address, and phone number in our directories if you initiate your telephone service with us online (unless you have requested a non-published or non-listed number)
If you provide individually identifiable information at an event Verizon sponsors with another company, or if you register on a co-sponsored Web site, you may be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement at the event or on the co-branded site to learn how the partner uses this information. Be assured that Verizon uses this information in accordance with this privacy policy.
On occasion, Verizon shares non-personally identifiable information with non-Verizon companies in order to assess the results of a promotion or event. This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you.

Does Verizon accommodate links to other sites?
Yes. Our site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. However, in some instances where a service is provided through a non-Verizon partner or supplier site, such as Online Bill Pay, you can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected. Verizon requires suppliers not to use the information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, protecting the privacy of your information.

What does Verizon do with non-personally identifiable information collected automatically?
Verizon uses cookies to collect this type of information in order to enhance your online experience as follows:
Ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live
Manage the number of ads that you see to avoid over-delivery of the same message
Tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences

What does Verizon do with personally identifiable information?
Personal information you voluntarily supply when obtaining information, purchasing products, or interacting with our advertising on verizon.com is not shared for use outside Verizon. This information is Verizon proprietary data and is not available to any outside company in this personalized form. Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Verizon will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and give you the opportunity to choose to opt out of such use.

Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?
No. Verizon does not combine offline information about you with the online information that you provide on our Web site.
We have made it a requirement that you will be clearly notified at the time of online data collection for the purpose of consumer profiling. When your online purchase behavior is intended to be combined with offline information, this intent will be clearly stated. You will then have the ability to choose not to have that information combined.

E-mail
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?
Verizon strives to continuously improve our customers' online experience by providing them with the latest information about the benefits of Verizon's products and services and in other circumstances described below. We may provide this information in any number of ways, including e-mails to our customers and online visitors who have provided their e-mail addresses to Verizon.

Security Issues
How does Verizon protect my personal information?
We are committed to protecting the information you give us, so we implement the appropriate safeguards to do so. Any information that you give us is protected by a password with a minimum of six characters for added security. Within Verizon, your information is stored in password-protected, limited-access servers. Wherever possible, Verizon servers reside behind a corporate firewall that maintains tight controls on any access to the system from both our internal network and the Internet. Verizon uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to transmit sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SSN. SSL is a transport level technology for authentication and data encryption between a Web server and a Web browser. SSL sends data over the "socket" which is a secure channel at the connection layer.
Does Verizon's Web site collect information from children?
Verizon believes that protecting the privacy of children on the
Internet is very important. The Verizon Web site is not designed to
attract children under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally
collect personal information from children on our Web sites. Ordering
online products and services is limited to adults 18 or over.
Children should exercise caution before providing personal information
online and should discuss with an adult or guardian before doing so.
Verizon also urges parents and guardians to consider using one of the
low-cost software programs designed to protect children while they are
online.

Cookies
What are cookies and why does Verizon use them?
A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard
drive. This data string contains your unique user ID for our Web
site. This technology also allows us to customize your experiences
when you visit the Verizon Web site. For example, we're able to
deliver content specific to your interests, keep track of your
online ordering and alert you to new products or money saving
opportunities based on your current services.
Back to Top
What information is collected by the site or in cookies?
Verizon collects non-personally identifiable information regarding your visit, usually in the form of cookies, log files, or clear .gif files. Cookies contain a session identification number that our systems use to recall previous authentication or order information from our servers. We may also collect your domain name, IP address, the address of the last URL you visited prior to coming to our Web site, and your browser and platform type. We use third party tracking services to help us analyze this information in the aggregate to evaluate the effectiveness of our site. In some cases, the information is collected directly by the third party and in others it is forwarded by Verizon to the third party. The third party is not permitted to use the information for any other purpose.

Online Advertising
What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third-party ad servers?
As an online advertiser, Verizon uses information supplied from third-party companies in several ways. This is aggregated data that does not personally identify any individual online user. This data is used to:
Evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plans
Geographically target advertising
Deliver product and pricing information applicable to the customer's state
Gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising
Again, personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address is not collected unless you voluntarily supply this data in order to get further information about Verizon products and services.
In addition, some Verizon Web sites -- for example, www.superpages.com -- may accept advertisements from third-party advertisers. These advertisers are carefully selected to provide information about products and services that we think may benefit you. Please check the privacy policy of these Web sites concerning what information may be collected by third-party advertisers.
Third-party advertising companies may also utilize technology in order to measure the effectiveness of ads. Some Verizon Web pages contain clear .gif files (also known as Web beacons), electronic images that allow the third party to collect anonymous information. This anonymous information about your visits to our site is used to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.
