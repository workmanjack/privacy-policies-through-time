PINTEREST PRIVACY POLICY
Effective February 2011
Cold
Brew Labs, Inc. (“Cold Brew Labs”, “our”, “us” or “we”)
provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures
regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive
from users of www.pinterest.com (this “Site”) and our corresponding application
for mobile devices (the “Application”). This Privacy Policy applies only to
information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to
time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the
new Privacy Policy on the Site or via the Application. You are advised to consult this policy
regularly for any changes. Unless
otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy
Policy have the same meanings as in our Pinterest Terms of Service, accessible
at http://pinterest.com/about/privacy.html.
As
used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include
using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other
analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not
limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using,
combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or
among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
Information Collection and Use
Our
primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site,
Application, services, features and content, to administer your membership
(together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily
navigate the Site and Application.
Personally Identifiable
Information.
o
When you register with us through the Site or Application to become a Member of Pinterest,
we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you
that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”).
Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, free-form biography, website and email address. You can register to join Pinterest via
the Site or Application or by logging into your account with certain third
party social networking sites (“SNS”)
(including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. If you decide to create your Account by
logging into a SNS via the Site, we will extract the Personal Information you
have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other
information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have
with such SNS and use that information to create your Account; the information
we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. For example, our Service allows users
to create an account and login to the Service using their Facebook account
credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a
Member and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to
enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and
join Pinterest. By using Facebook Connect, you are
allowing Pinterest to access your Facebook account information and you are
agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Service via
Facebook
o We use your Personal
Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. We
will create your Account for your use of the Site and Application based upon
the Personal Information you provide and you will become a Member of Pinterest.
o
We also collect
the other information that you provide as part of registration and the
administration and personalization of your profile webpage on Pinterest (e.g., without limitation, age and
individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).
o
We use your
Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and
administer your inquiries.
o
Certain
Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal
Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for
example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way
that enables you to be identified. But
the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information
when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying
information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information
with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected
from other Pinterest Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a
better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze
and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use
the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for
instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or
restrictions.
o
We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Pinterest
newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may
be of interest to you. If you
decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the
communications or update your “preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,”
below.)
Log Data. When you visit the Site or Application, whether as
a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Pinterest User”), our servers automatically record information that your
browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information
such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to
our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the
time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and
Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and
analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and
Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application’s
functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application
to our visitors’ needs. For
example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site
and Application again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other
information appropriate to your interests.
We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site and
Application meet the criteria required to process their requests. [We do not treat Log Data as Personal
Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we
may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as
stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
Cookies
Like many websites, our Site and Application use
“cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we
transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk for record-keeping
purposes. We use cookies for two
purposes. First, we utilize
persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site
and Application. Second, we utilize
session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to
better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor
aggregate usage by Pinterest Users
and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session
cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site,
Application and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also
place or read cookies on your browser.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its
options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all
portions of the Site and Application or all functionality of the Service.
Emailing Via a Pinterest
Account
As part of the Service, Pinterest Members may
communicate with other Members and non-registered users through use of their Accounts. Where Members have selected the option
of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they
create in the corresponding template will be sent from Pinterest to those email
addresses on their behalf. These
email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication
to the addressee.
Phishing
Identity theft and the practice currently known as
“phishing” are of great concern to Cold Brew Labs. Safeguarding information to help protect
you from identity theft is a top priority.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card
information, login information, or national identification numbers in a
non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing,
visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
Information
Sharing and Disclosure
Pinterest
Users. When you register through the Site and Application and submit Personal
Information to create a profile or visual collection, Pinterest Users will see
your name. If you choose to provide
additional Personal Information in your profile, Pinterest Users will see such
additional Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your photo,
location, website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information
is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to
have with Pinterest Users. We recommend that you guard your sensitive
information.
Aggregate Information and
Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that
does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose
Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry
analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information
shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Service Providers. We may
employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to
provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site and Application-related
services (e.g., without limitation,
maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the
Site and Application’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site,
Application and Service are used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to
perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it
for any other purpose.
Social Networking Sites. We may share the information in your
account (including your Personal Information) with the SNSs that you have
linked to your account. These third
parties have access to your Personal Information only for this purpose (unless
the SNS has received your Personal Information independently of the Service)
and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Facebook Connect. We allow users to automatically
post recent activity back to Facebook, and give them the option to disable
Facebook Connect at any time by logging into their profile and selecting the
option to disable Facebook Connect. Further, you may be able to edit your
privacy settings for the content that you post which appears on Facebook by
making selections in your “Edit Profile” settings via the Site and Application.
Compliance with Laws and Law
Enforcement. Cold Brew
Labs cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private
parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about
you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our
sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and
legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas), to protect the
property and rights of Cold Brew Labs or
a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent
or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal,
unethical or legally actionable activity.
Business Transfers. Cold
Brew Labs may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its
assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger,
acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
bankruptcy.
Changing
or Deleting Your Information
All Members may review, update, correct or delete the
Personal Information in their Account by contacting us or by editing such
profile via the Site and Application.
If you completely delete all such
information, then your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of
your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
Security
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site or via the Application in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained
on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as
those in your jurisdiction. If you
are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Cold
Brew Labs transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it
there. Your consent to this Privacy
Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your
agreement to that transfer.
Links to Other Sites
Our Site and Application contains
links to other websites. If you
choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of
advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to
that third party’s website. The
fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of
advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our
affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or
practices. We do not exercise
control over third party websites.
These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules
regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to
them. We encourage you to read the
privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
Our Policy Toward Children
This Site and Application are not directed
to children under 13. We do not
knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
13. If a parent or guardian
becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information
without their consent, he or she should contact us at hi@Pinterest.com If we become aware that a child
under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such
information from our files.
