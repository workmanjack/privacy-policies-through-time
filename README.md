# privacy-policies-through-time

Some sites are easier than others

* Glassdoor - from 2015 to about 2018, Glassdoor had its privacy policy split between two pages. The first page (we'll call it "the overview page"), and an updated revision date. The second page, the "full policy page", had a revision date as well, but this one was not kept up to_date. In these situations, you can add a second "date_url" to your config from which to retrieve a date. However, it doesn't quite work.
