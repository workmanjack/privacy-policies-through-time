# privacy-policies-through-time

Some sites are easier than others

* Glassdoor - from 2015 to about 2018, Glassdoor had its privacy policy split between two pages. The first page (we'll call it "the overview page"), and an updated revision date. The second page, the "full policy page", had a revision date as well, but this one was not kept up to_date. In these situations, you can add a second "date_url" to your config from which to retrieve a date. However, it doesn't quite work.
* LinkedIn - at a certain point after 2015, the archived versions of LinkedIn's privacy policy are no longer usable. It looks like cookies or something might have blocked the archive from collecting the webpages. See this as an example: https://web.archive.org/web/20180312014548/https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv
* Oracle's website's privacy policy is not retrievable via the wayback machine from 2002-2008. The page is viewable but not scrapeable.
